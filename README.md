# TrickOrTreat
A game for the Foenix Game Jam Oct 2024. Get snacks to all the trick or treaters

Your neighbors have gone out to a halloween party. You're not much of a party goer yourself, so you offer to stay home and give out candy to all the kids for your three neighbors.

You better be in shape as you run from one door to the next tossing candy to the kids so you can get to the next door to do the same. Don't throw too much candy, you might run out.
As the night goes on, the kids seem to be moving faster and your candy availability seems to be reduced. What the heck is going on???

just make sure nobody gets to the steps, or it's game over!
